Breast Cancer Machine Learning model

## Assignment #2 (Git, GitHub, ML)

I am using UCI ML Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset from UCI machine learning repository. It will be loaded from sklearn.datasets

Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer in women in cities, and the second most common cancer in women in rural areas. We identify most breast cancers at an advanced stage is because of a lack of knowledge of the disease and the lack of a breast cancer screening program.With this case study, I hope to show the possibilities of a Decision tree for healthcare analysis-based machine learning algorithms in the early detection of breast cancer through test results and features.

## Model Version 1 : Decision Trees

With this case study, I hope to show the possibilities of a Decision tree for healthcare analysis-based machine learning algorithms in the early detection of breast cancer through test results and features.

A Decision Tree algorithm is one of the most popular machine learning algorithms. It uses a tree like structure and their possible combinations to solve a particular problem. It belongs to the class of supervised learning algorithms where it can be used for both classification and regression purposes.
The Decision Tree algorithm intuition is as follows:-
For each attribute in the dataset, the Decision-Tree algorithm forms a node. The most important attribute is placed at the root node.
For evaluating the task in hand, we start at the root node and we work our way down the tree by following the corresponding node that meets our condition or decision.
This process continues until a leaf node is reached. It contains the prediction or the outcome of the Decision Tree.

## Model version 2 : ANN

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are useful due to their ability to recognize patterns, handle non-linear relationships, adapt and generalize to new information, automatically extract relevant features, scale with large datasets, perform parallel processing, automate tasks, and their versatility across various applications. Breast cancer detection using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) is a commonly employed approach in medical imaging and diagnosis.
