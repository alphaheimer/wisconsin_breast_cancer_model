## Model version 2 : ANN

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are useful due to their ability to recognize patterns, handle non-linear relationships, adapt and generalize to new information, automatically extract relevant features, scale with large datasets, perform parallel processing, automate tasks, and their versatility across various applications. Breast cancer detection using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) is a commonly employed approach in medical imaging and diagnosis.
